# NoiseHub

## Summary
College study spaces are often inconsistently managed. That variability can hinder a student’s productivity, especially when they spend time finding a comfortable location rather than studying. NoiseHub aims to give students the ability to find the perfect study space by providing accurate temperature, headcount, and noise information about locations.  This is done using a small embedded system consisting of Raspberry Pi’s and sensors that can be mounted easily in any room. With our backend hosted on AWS, data is compiled into a user friendly format on the NoiseHub companion app.
